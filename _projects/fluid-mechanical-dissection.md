## Project Overview

For MAE 3230 (Fluid Mechanics), I created a video dissection and analysis of a two-stage reciprocating air compressor. This project explores the fundamental fluid mechanics principles governing compressed air systems, including thermodynamic cycles, pressure ratios, intercooling, and multi-stage compression efficiency. The dissection reveals the internal components and explains how air progresses through each compression stage, examining pressure changes, heat transfer, and the practical considerations that make two-stage compression more efficient than single-stage alternatives for high-pressure applications.
