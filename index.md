## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I'm Toby Huynh, a junior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. Before pursuing a career in engineering, my foundation into STEM came through pursuing my FAA Airframe and Powerplant certification. My journey began on the hangar floor, performing line maintenance on commercial aircraft at Delta Airlines, and leading a team in restoring and testing a Gulfstream G100. In Cornell, my work has evolved into fabricating and designing autonomous flight systems and aerodynamics research.

What drives me is the intersection between hands-on problem solving and ground-breaking engineering. Whether I'm troubleshooting the fuel system on a turbofan engine or designing electrical systems for autonomous flight, I bring a mechanic's practical intuition combined with an engineer's analytical mindset. I'm motivated by understanding complex systems from multiple angles, from the engineering principles that make flight possible, to the practical constraints of manufacturing and maintenance. My goal is to contribute to the next generation of innovative technology, where reliability, performance, and innovation converge.
